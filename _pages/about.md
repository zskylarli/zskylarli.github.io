Hello! My name is Skylar (Zhuoyan) Li and I am currently a 1st year PhD student in the Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Previously, I was a Computational Biologist in the [Satija Lab](https://satijalab.org/), located at the New York Genome Center and affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. After growing up and attending high school in Japan, I attended the Fu Foundation of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Columbia University and graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a Minor in Art History.

My research has focused on large-scale analyses of single-cell genomics data using advanced computational and statistical methods. Specifically, I am interested in leveraging single-cell atlases to identify cell identities and contexutualize transcriptomic information by integrating observational data, with the ultimate goal of discovering underlying gene regulation mecahnisms responsible for stratifing biological responses. 

In my undergraduate research at the [Danino Lab](https://daninolab.nyc/research), I was involved in developing bacterial biosensors by designing dynamic gene circuits to produce visually detectable swarming behaviors in response to environmental changes. During this time, I gained experience in both bench experiments and image analysis work, which was invaluable to my training in biomedical engineering. 

Outside of research, I have been passionate about art since working as a museum guide on Teshima island during the Setouchi Triennale in 2019, and have since worked on independent and collaborative projects thanks to support from the Danino Lab.

In my free time, I love exercising (running, pilates, yoga), music (recreationally & through DJ-ing), writing, and visiting museums!
